1.Built an interactive web app called "GNN Explorer" that lets users build, train, and test Graph Neural Networks without writing any code.

2.Created a dynamic model builder where users can design custom GNNs by stacking different types of layers (like GCN, GAT, and SAGE).

3.Included a full analysis toolkit that shows training progress with live charts, displays key performance scores, and provides an interactive graph to explore how the model makes predictions for individual nodes.

4.Added an automated tuning feature that runs many experiments to automatically find the best-performing model and hyperparameters for the selected dataset.

5.Developed a comparison dashboard for running standard GNN models side-by-side to easily see which one performs best.
